HelloWorld Code Challenge - User Registration Form

This code was tested on Chrome 48.0.2564.97 (64-bit).

PHP version 5.4.43 was pre-installed on the server.  As a result, all function calls to interact with the MySQL database use the 
old MySQL extension rather than the new MySQLi that is available as of PHP 7.0.0.
